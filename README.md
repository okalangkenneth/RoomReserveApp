# RoomReserveApp

### A practical approach to consuming a RESTFul Web service using Vue.js


## Description

In this project I developed a room reservation app using Vue.js for the front-end, ASP.NET Core Web API for the back-end, and Microsoft SQL Server for the database. The app allows users to search for and book rooms at hotels and other types of accommodations, and includes features such as browsing listings, viewing room details, and making secure online payments. The app is powered by a reliable and efficient back-end and database and has the potential to revolutionize the way people book rooms for their travels.
